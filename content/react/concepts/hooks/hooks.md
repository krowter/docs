In React, **hooks** are functions that give class-like abilities to function components, include [state](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/state) and side-effects.

There are a few rules when using hooks! Specifically:

- Call hooks at the top level of React functions. If hooks are called in a loop, condition, or nested function, they may not render in the same order every time.
- Call hooks from React functions and not regular JavaScript functions.

While there are standard React hooks, like `useState()` and `useEffect()`, there are also custom-made hooks!

Hooks are imported at the top of a file from the `react` library:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
```

## Syntax of `useState()`

Pass an `initialValue` into `useState()` to return a pair of new values:

- A current `state` value
- A function, `setState` that updates the `state`

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

`useState()` returns an array. The first element is the `initialValue` assigned to `state`. The second element is a function with a similar use case as React's `this.setState()` class component method.

## Syntax of `useEffect()`

The `useEffect()` hook and function will execute whenever a component mounts or updates. It is equivalent to React's class component lifecycle methods: `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()`, and `componentWillUnmount()`.

A callback function, `sideEffects()`, is passed into `useEffect()`. In addition, the component's `state` can be accessed inside of `sideEffect()`.

```jsx
useEffect(function sideEffects() {
  ...
})
```

The default behavior for effects is to invoke the effect after every completed render.

To fire the effect function conditionally, a second argument is passed to `useEffect`. This argument is an array of values that the effect depends on.

**Note:** When registering event listeners inside the effect function, it is not ideal to call them every time a component rerenders. Registering a new listener on every update might cause memory leaks.

```jsx
useEffect(function sideEffects() {
  ...
}, [dep1, dep2, ...]); // Re-runs the effect if a value in the array changes
```

In the example below, the effect runs the first time a component mounts. Subsequent rerenders don't fire the effect. This might be useful for setting up a subscription to an external service or registering event listeners.

```jsx
useEffect(function sideEffects() {
  ...
}, []); // Runs the effect when a component renders the first time
```
